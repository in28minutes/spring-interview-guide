### 1.Loose Coupling vs Tight Coupling
**Tight Coupling**

Tight coupling refers to a situation where components in a system are highly dependent on each other. This means that a change in one component often necessitates changes in other components. Tight coupling can lead to systems that are hard to maintain, test, and extend because the interconnectedness means that altering one part of the system has wide-ranging effects.

**Example of Tight Coupling:**

Consider a class `A` that uses a class `B` directly:

```java
class B {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in B");
    }\
}

class A {
    private B b = new B();

    public void execute() {
        b.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this example, `A` is tightly coupled to `B`. If `B` changes (e.g., if the method `doSomething` is renamed or its parameters change), `A` also needs to be updated to accommodate these changes.

**Loose Coupling**

Loose coupling refers to a situation where components in a system have little or no knowledge of the definitions of other components. This makes the system more modular, easier to maintain, test, and extend because changes in one component are less likely to impact others.

**Example of Loose Coupling:**

Using interfaces or dependency injection can help achieve loose coupling. Here's how the above example can be refactored for loose coupling:

```java
interface Service {
    void doSomething();
}

class B implements Service {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in B");
    }
}

class A {
    private Service service;

    public A(Service service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void execute() {
        service.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this example, `A` depends on an interface `Service` rather than a concrete class `B`. This way, `A` is not directly dependent on `B`. You can change the implementation of `B` or use a different implementation of `Service` without changing `A`:

```java
class AnotherService implements Service {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in AnotherService");
    }
}

// Using the loosely coupled setup
Service service = new AnotherService();
A a = new A(service);
a.execute();  // Output: Doing something in AnotherService
```

**Benefits of Loose Coupling:**
- **Flexibility**: Components can be replaced or updated independently.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, test, and modify.
- **Scalability**: New features or components can be added without significant refactoring.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts.

In summary, tight coupling creates a rigid system where components are heavily interdependent, whereas loose coupling promotes a more modular, flexible, and maintainable system.****

### 2.What is Dependency?

- A **dependency** in software engineering is a relationship where one component or module relies on another to function. 
- Dependencies can be between classes, functions, modules, services, or even entire applications. 
- Managing dependencies is crucial for building maintainable, scalable, and flexible software.

#### Example of Dependency

Consider two classes, `Car` and `Engine`. The `Car` class depends on the `Engine` class to function:

```java
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Car depends on Engine
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Car` is tightly coupled to `Engine`, meaning `Car` directly creates an instance of `Engine` and relies on it to function.

****
### 3.What is Dependency Injection?

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. 
- Instead of a class creating its dependencies, they are provided externally. 
- This promotes loose coupling and makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

#### Example of Dependency Injection

Using the same `Car` and `Engine` example, but applying dependency injection:

1. **Define the Engine Interface:**

```java
public interface Engine {
    void start();
}
```

2. **Implement the Engine Interface:**

```java
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine started");
    }
}

public class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Diesel engine started");
    }
}
```

3. **Modify the Car Class to Use Dependency Injection:**

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Constructor Injection
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
```

4. **Inject Dependencies in the Main Method:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine petrolEngine = new PetrolEngine();
        Car carWithPetrolEngine = new Car(petrolEngine);
        carWithPetrolEngine.drive();

        Engine dieselEngine = new DieselEngine();
        Car carWithDieselEngine = new Car(dieselEngine);
        carWithDieselEngine.drive();
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Dependency Injection

1. **Loose Coupling:** By injecting dependencies, classes are less dependent on specific implementations, making the system more flexible.
2. **Testability:** Dependencies can be easily mocked or stubbed, making unit testing simpler and more effective.
3. **Maintainability:** Changes in dependencies require minimal changes in dependent classes.
4. **Reusability:** Components can be reused with different dependencies without modification.

### Types of Dependency Injection

1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
    ```java
    public class Car {
        private Engine engine;

        public Car(Engine engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
    ```java
    public class Car {
        private Engine engine;

        public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Interface Injection:** Dependencies are provided through an interface. (Less common)
    ```java
    public interface Engine {
        void injectCar(Car car);
    }
    ```

### Conclusion

Dependency and Dependency Injection are core concepts in software design that promote modularity, flexibility, and testability. By externalizing the creation and management of dependencies, you can build more maintainable and adaptable software systems.

### Classes vs. Objects in Java

**Classes** and **objects** are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Hereâ€™s a brief explanation along with examples to illustrate the difference between them.

### Classes

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

#### Example of a Class

```java
public class Car {
    // Properties (attributes)
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method (behavior)
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + ", Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Car` is a class with three properties: `brand`, `model`, and `year`.
- It has a constructor to initialize these properties.
- It has a method `displayInfo` to display the information of the car.

### Objects

An **object** is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on the class blueprint and occupies memory.

#### Example of Objects

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects from the Car class
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2021);

        // Calling methods on the objects
        car1.displayInfo();
        car2.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `car1` and `car2` are objects (instances) of the `Car` class.
- Each object has its own set of properties (`brand`, `model`, and `year`).
- The `displayInfo` method is called on each object to display its details.

### Key Differences

1. **Definition:**
   - **Class:** A template or blueprint for creating objects.
   - **Object:** An instance of a class.

2. **Memory Allocation:**
   - **Class:** Does not occupy memory until an object is created.
   - **Object:** Occupies memory when it is instantiated.

3. **Usage:**
   - **Class:** Defines the structure and behaviors that the objects will have.
   - **Object:** Represents individual instances that can have different states.

### Visual Representation

Consider a class as a blueprint for building a house:
- The **blueprint (class)** defines the structure, layout, and design of houses.
- **Houses (objects)** built from this blueprint can be different instances with unique colors, owners, and furniture but follow the same general design.

In summary:
- **Class:** Defines the properties and behaviors.
- **Object:** Is a specific instance of a class with actual values for the properties and capable of exhibiting the defined behaviors.
****

### 4.What is Inversion of Control (IOC)?
- Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in software engineering where the control flow of a program is inverted. 
- Instead of the application controlling the flow, an external entity or framework takes over that control. 
- IoC is often used in conjunction with dependency injection to create more flexible, maintainable, and testable software.

### Key Concepts

1. **Traditional Control Flow:**
   - In a traditional setup, the application code directly controls the execution flow and manages dependencies. For example, creating objects, calling methods, etc.

2. **Inversion of Control:**
   - With IoC, the control is inverted. The framework or container takes over the responsibility of managing the flow of control and the lifecycle of objects. The application code provides configuration and business logic, while the framework handles the rest.

### How IoC Works

IoC can be implemented in various ways, such as using dependency injection, service locators, or event-driven programming. The most common approach is dependency injection.

### Dependency Injection and IoC

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a technique used to achieve IoC by injecting dependencies into objects rather than the objects creating the dependencies themselves.

#### Example of IoC with Dependency Injection

Here's an example to illustrate IoC using dependency injection:

#### Without IoC

```java
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Car creates its own Engine
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

In this traditional setup, the `Car` class directly controls the creation of its `Engine` dependency.

#### With IoC (Dependency Injection)

```java
public interface Engine {
    void start();
}

public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine started");
    }
}

public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Dependency is injected via constructor
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine engine = new PetrolEngine(); // Engine dependency is created outside
        Car car = new Car(engine);          // Engine is injected into Car
        car.drive();
    }****
}
```

In this setup, the control of creating the `Engine` object is inverted. The `Car` class does not create its own `Engine` object but receives it from outside (injected through the constructor).

### Benefits of IoC

1. **Decoupling:**
   - Objects are less tightly coupled because they do not create their own dependencies. This makes the code more modular and flexible.

2. **Ease of Testing:**
   - Dependencies can be easily mocked or stubbed, facilitating unit testing.

3. **Reusability:**
   - Components can be reused more easily in different contexts because they are not tied to specific implementations of their dependencies.

4. **Maintainability:**
   - The application is easier to maintain and extend because changes to dependencies require minimal changes to the dependent classes.

### Summary

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle that shifts the control of program execution and dependency management from the application code to an external framework or container. Dependency injection is a common method to achieve IoC, resulting in decoupled, testable, and maintainable code.

### 5.What is Bean in Spring?

In simple terms, a **bean** in the context of the Spring Framework is an object that is created, configured, and managed by the Spring container. Think of a bean as a component or building block of a Spring application that Spring takes care of for you.

### Key Points in Simple Terms:

1. **Object**: A bean is just a regular Java object.
2. **Managed by Spring**: Instead of you creating and managing this object directly in your code, Spring does it for you.
3. **Configuration**: You tell Spring how to create and configure this object either through XML files, Java annotations, or Java configuration classes.
4. **Dependency Injection**: Spring can inject dependencies into your beans, which means it can set up and connect the different parts of your application automatically.

### Simple Example:

Imagine you have a `Car` that needs an `Engine` to run. In Spring:

1. **Define the Beans**:
   - You tell Spring about the `Car` and `Engine` objects.

```java
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
```

2. **Configuration with Annotations**:
   - Use `@Component` to tell Spring these are the objects it should manage.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
```

3. **Spring Takes Care of the Rest**:
   - You donâ€™t have to create and wire up the `Car` and `Engine` objects manually. Spring does it for you.

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        Car car = context.getBean(Car.class);
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

In this setup:
- Spring creates the `Engine` and `Car` objects.
- Spring injects the `Engine` into the `Car` automatically.

### Summary:

A **bean** is a Spring-managed object that Spring takes care of creating, configuring, and wiring together with other beans. This helps simplify your application code and manage dependencies more effectively.
