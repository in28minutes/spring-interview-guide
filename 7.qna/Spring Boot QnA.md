### 1. Why Spring Boot?
- Spring based applications have a lot of configuration.
- When we use Spring MVC, we need to configure ComponentScan, DispatcherServlet, a view resolver, web jars, and more.
- Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring framework. It provides a simpler and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.
- World is moving towards microservices and cloud-native applications. Spring Boot is the best choice for building microservices.

### 2. What are Spring Boot goals?
- Quick start to Spring.
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify build configuration.
- Non functional features like monitoring, error handling, embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.
